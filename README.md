The Star Wars generator application is based on the Javascript fetch API, particularly , the SWAPI.
This programme employs the Math module to randomize characters in the Star wars film
I used the information obtained from the API as an object by first stringifying the JSON file using the JSON.stringify() function
After stringifying the file, I then casted the information back into an object that could be read by Javascript using the JSON.Parse() function.
This application features an event handler, that will, when pressed, randomize the number of characters according to the SWAPI link.
To make some of the values in the object fit into the designated divs, i used  the texty overflow feature in  CSS to ensure that the user will be able to scroll through
the div and see all the information they need to access.
